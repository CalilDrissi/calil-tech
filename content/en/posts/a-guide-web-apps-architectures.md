This guide to web application development briefly covers the basics of the topic. We will explore what is web application architecture, its main components, the types of web application architecture, as well as web server architecture types. Get a good understanding of web application architecture.

## What is a Web Application Architecture?
![webarchitecture](/images/feature2/monolithic-vs-microservices.png "webarchitecture")

Web application architecture defines the interactions between applications, middleware systems and databases to ensure multiple applications can work together. When a user types in a URL and taps “Go,” the browser will find the Internet-facing computer the website lives on and requests that particular page.

The server then responds by sending files over to the browser. After that action, the browser executes those files to show the requested page to the user. Now, the user gets to interact with the website. Of course, all of these actions are executed within a matter of seconds. Otherwise, users wouldn’t bother with websites.

What’s important here is the code, which has been parsed by the browser. This very code may or may not have specific instructions telling the browser how to react to a wide swath of inputs. As a result, web application architecture includes all sub-components and external applications interchanges for an entire software application.

Of course, it is designed to function efficiently while meeting its specific needs and goals. Web application architecture is critical since the majority of global network traffic, and every single app and device uses web-based communication. It deals with scale, efficiency, robustness, and security.


## How Web Application Architecture Works
![webapp](/images/feature2/web-app.png "web-app")
With web apps, you have the **Back-End** & the **Front-End**. In a nutshell, there are two programs running concurently:
1. Front-End: The code which lives in the browser and responds to user input
2. Back-End: The code which lives on the server and responds to **HTTP requests**

In fact, any code that can respond to HTTP requests has the capability to run on a server. Here are a few other attributes of server-side code:

* Is never seen by the user (except within a rare malfunction)
* Stores data such as user profiles, tweets, pages, etc…
* Creates the page the user requested

With client-side code, languages used include:

* CSS
* Javascript
* HTML

These are then parsed by the user’s browser. Moreover, client-side code can be seen and edited by the user. Plus, it has to communicate only through HTTP requests and cannot read files off of a server directly. Furthermore, it reacts to user input.

## The Importance of Scalability in Web Apps Architecture

The reason why it is imperative to have good web application architecture is because it is the blueprint for supporting future growth which may come from increased demand, future interoperability and enhanced reliability requirements.
the organizational design of web application architecture defines precisely how an application will function. Some features include:

* Delivering persistent data through HTTP, which can be understood by client-side code and vice-versa
* Making sure requests contain valid data
* Offers authentication for users
* Limits what users can see based on permissions
* Creates, updates and deletes records

## Best Practices for Good Web Application Architecture

You may have a working app, but it also needs to have good web architecture. Here are several attributes necessary for good web application architecture:

* Solves problems consistently and uniformly
* Is as simple as possible
* Supports the latest standards include A/B testing and analytics
* Offers fast response times
* Utilizes security standards to reduce the chance of malicious penetrations
* Does not crash
* Heals itself
* Does not have a single point of failure
* Scales out easily
* Allows for easy creation of known data
* Errors logged in a user-friendly way
* Automated deployments

The reason the above factors are necessary is because, with the right attributes, you can build a better app. Not to mention, by supporting horizontal and vertical growth, software deployment is much more efficient, user-friendly and reliable. While web application architecture is vitally important, don’t forget to check out our BuildBetter archives for more tips and resources on building better apps from planning to post-production.

## Conclusion

Web application architecture is the backbone of any web-based solution, so its success largely depends on how well it is thought-out. Put the pieces together according to the technical requirements and aim of your web solution, and your product will work properly, appeal to the right audience, and reap the benefits.
