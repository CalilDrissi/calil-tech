Hi! my name is Calil[^1] Drissi, I develop full-stack web applications using the MERN stack mostly, but not exclusively, in addition to that I create software for desktop & mobile platforms, for the iot field and occasionally for other domains. I also write about computer technologies on both software and hardware. I'm self-taught, based in Morocco. Checkout some of my projects [here.](http://calil.tech/showcase) 

You can contact me via [email](mailto:reach@calil.tech) or schedule an online [meeting.](http://calendly.com/calildrissi)
